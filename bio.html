				The following was my college essay. It will give you far more insight into who I am if you take the time to read it than a short biography would. Never be embarassed about your struggles, they define you.

             	Launch lunch, hurl, wax the floor, upchuck, vomit. Whatever you call it, I was doing it. A squished rotten banana, ketchup on eggs, a plate of devoured chicken wings, or the smell of corned beef: any insult to my senses triggered instantaneous nausea, clammy hands, and then panic. Quietly excusing myself, I rushed to greet the toilet. Hot tears streamed down my face as I asked myself, "Why does this happen to me?" and then proceeded to empty my stomach into the porcelain bowl.
             	
				It became clear in preschool that I had inherited the perfect storm of genetics: a hyper sense of smell and a gag reflex from my father more active than Vesuvius, and a stomach from my mother's family that was weaker than the excuse that the dog ate my homework. Until fifth grade, my high frequency of vomiting had no adverse effects on my happiness. I could toss my cookies one minute and toss a football the next. Upon entering middle school I was forced to share a crowded cafeteria with three hundred fifth graders. I became afraid of throwing up in public. The fact that I threw up so often made me nervous, which ironically, only caused me to throw up more.  As the year progressed, the anxiety transferred to situations such as riding the bus, eating in restaurants, and sleeping at friends’ houses. The common denominator was lack of control over exposure to triggers and the inability to escape the confines of public scrutiny. 
             	
      		    In my world, where logic and reason had always ruled, the inability to control my feelings pained me. As a high achieving student, I was accustomed to finding correct solutions to challenging problems. For the first time in my life, I was stumped. After my parents and pediatrician exhausted their efforts to help, we sought alternatives including reflexology, aromatherapy, and counseling. Traditional counseling was very difficult; discussing my anxiety produced memories of nausea and, consequently, made me so nauseous during sessions that I was unable to converse. As a ten year old, I lay awake at night and wondered how I would ever accomplish goals as big as attending summer camp and as small as taking out the trash. 
             	
				I struggled internally, keeping most around me unaware of my fears. Outwardly, I appeared to be a happy middle schooler, busy with soccer games, trumpet lessons, and presiding over the fifth and sixth grade student council. However, my anxiety prevented me from always being my honest self. I found ways to circumvent and combat my fears: ever present minty Tic Tacs in my pocket became a life line, my family avoided restaurants that were overpowering to my sense of smell, and I invited friends to sleep at my house before being invited to theirs. In fifth grade, I joined the stage crew of the musical Oliver! Jr. because rehearsals took place during lunch which meant I didn’t have to be trapped in the noxious cafeteria. I quickly discovered that I preferred to be in front of the curtain rather than behind it and agreed to a small speaking role, sparking a career in drama that has found me on stage in major roles every year since. Many experience stage fright; I found that performing in front of my peers was a much easier task than sitting through lunch in the cafeteria.
             	
     		 	Despite my worst fears that I would never shake off my anxiety, by ninth grade, I had learned to control my nausea and the anxiety abated. There was no magic bullet; a combination of cognitive behavioral therapy, maturity, family support, and a strong will to feel normal again was the concoction I needed. I wouldn’t choose a complicated 	struggle such as mine, but now I can admit that the anxiety had a benefit. Being on stage is a true passion that, doubtfully, I would have found otherwise. I bring a believable range of emotions to my characters; the fear that Otto Frank felt in face of the Germans was no more severe than the fear I felt in the face of my own enemy.  Empathy is now part of my personal character as I appreciate that everyone struggles in some way at some time. I shared my experience with Zachary, a family friend, who suffered very severe anxiety, and Stephen, my brother’s best friend, who battled separation anxiety. The story of my irrational fear that felt so terrifyingly real helped them to realize that their own anxieties with no known cause, although real to them, had no strong root in reality. On the other hand, their parents listened intently while I convinced them that the panic their sons felt was as real as if a wild tiger was standing directly in front of them. They were surprised by my unusual but solvable dilemma and it provided them with hope that their sons could overcome their anxiety. Both received professional help and moved beyond their unique situations. 
             	
				I may never be fully relieved of my weak stomach or my gag reflex but I have gained control over their hold on me and through adversity I have learned resiliency and gained confidence to branch out beyond my comfort zone. There is freedom in knowing that there is not a fierce opponent on the tennis court, puzzling problem on an important exam or awkward social situation that is as insurmountable as the perceived fear that once lived in my own head. The greatest weakness of my childhood may end up being my greatest strength.
             	
				By the summer before ninth grade, I had learned to control my nausea and the anxiety abated. There was no magic bullet, a combination of cognitive behavioral therapy, maturing, family support, and a strong will to feel normal again was the medicine I needed. While at the time I felt I could never escape my anxiety, I truly benefited from my struggle. I gained the pleasure of performing in theater, a true passion of mine that I probably would not have found otherwise. I am a very empathetic person, and have helped other friends by sharing my experience. I may never fully get rid of my weak stomach, or my gag reflex, but through adversity I have learned resiliency and gained confidence in myself and my ability to branch out to things out of my comfort zone. It turns out the greatest weakness of my childhood may end up being my greatest strength.
