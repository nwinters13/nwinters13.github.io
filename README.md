Homepage fun!

Turns out this is much more confusing than I thought.
I didn't realize how many small rules were going on.

Things I found annoying:

I can't center my image! I want to so bad and I couldn't
get it to work so I ended up making my boxes make it look 
centered.

<p> cant go in <h#> which I didn't realize and had
	to change some styling

Margins turned out to be my enemy at points as well.

Overall it was a pretty fun time and I definitely need to 
work on my MENTAl styling because it's really not that pretty
and I can make it look much nicer. Definitely something I will
work on in the future because I want it to be something I can link
people to.
